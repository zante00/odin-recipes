    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This is the story of a little bowl of rice. It's not a very exciting story. In fact, one might
        consider it to be a bit plain. It is, however, important none the less. That's because a whole
        nation, a whole <strong>people</strong> depend heavily on this plain carbohydrate.

        It all started when a child, penniless and starving, ignored his mother's pleas to help in the 
        yard work and wandered into town. There he saw a man with little white beans. The man said that
        if they were to be planted in water, they would grow more. The boy, starving and desperate and 
        curious, traded the rags he called his only clothes for the magical beans. Then he ate them and
        wandered back home to his mother.

        The lashings from his mother and subsequent hard labor as punishment for leaving for town on his
        own and losing his only clothes distracted the child from his iritation with the meager meal he 
        had sold his clothes for. The next day the child had a terrible bellyache. The pain was so great
        that he could barely stand, but his mother, believing the pain to be made up to avoid more work, 
        simply beat the boy again and forced him out into the field. Delirious from pain, the boy stumbled
        about, not really doing much of anything, until he fell face down into a puddle leftover from the 
        last rain.

        Hours passed before the boy's mother began to care that she hadn't seen her child doing any work.
        As she searched for him, furious that he would dare skip out again, she came across a strange plant
        growing out of a puddle in the road. Curious, she harvested the plant and took it into town to see
        if the wise woman knew of it, and if her useless son was there again. While asking after the wise
        woman, the man who sold the white beans to the boy recognised the plant and congradulated the mother's 
        son on being able to properly grow the plant, and proceeded to explain how to properly harvest and 
        eat the rice.
